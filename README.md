Inspired by the "Sound of Sorting": https://panthema.net/2013/sound-of-sorting/

While I was learning about sorting algorithms in college, I discovered
the sound of sorting video on youtube and thought it was one of the
coolest things ever; naturally, I set out to reinvent the wheel and
create my own, worse version of the project.
